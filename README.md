# Movie Trailer Website

In this project we are creating a website showing my favorite movies names along with their posters.  
When we click on the poster the trailer of thet movie will be played in a modal and closes when we click on the space outside the modal.

## How to view it ?

1. Install Python in your laptop/workstation.  
   <https://www.python.org/downloads/>  
2. Clone this repository to your laptop/workstation.  
3. Open terminal(linux)/cmd(windows) and change your working directory to the cloned folder.  
   In windows(cmd) : `cd /d {{Folder_location}}`  
   In linux : `cd {{Folder_location}}`  
4. Run the entertainment_center.py file in the folder using the command:  
   `python entertainment_center.py`  
5. The website will automatically pops up in your default browser.  
6. If not open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` page that is created in the folder.
